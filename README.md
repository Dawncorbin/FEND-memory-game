# Memory Game Project by Dawn

Memory Game Project - Udacity project developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Instructions

How To Play: this is a memory matching card game. The goal is to match each card's icon with its pair. There are 16 cards and 8 pairs total. Click on a card, remember its icon and spot it in the grid. Then continue clicking other cards until you find its match. The game ends once all pairs are matched.

Keep track of progress in the score panel area by viewing the star rating guide. You'll also see how many moves have been made and the time it took to finish the game.

There was a starter code for this project.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
